##AWS Amplify React+Vite Starter Template
This repository provides a starter template for creating applications using React+Vite and AWS Amplify, focusing on easy setup for authentication, API, database capabilities, and AI-driven health and fitness insights.

##Overview
This template equips you with a foundational React application integrated with AWS Amplify, optimized for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their projects with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB, along with AI-powered health and fitness recommendations.

For API handling, the template uses AWS Lambda and API Gateway. When an HTTP request is made, it hits the API Gateway, which triggers a corresponding Lambda function. The Lambda function processes the request and sends back the appropriate response, ensuring efficient and scalable API interactions.


##Features
Authentication: Set up with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.
API: Ready-to-use GraphQL endpoint with AWS AppSync.
Database: Real-time database powered by Amazon DynamoDB.
Health and Fitness Tracking:
User Profile: Users can submit their details such as sex, age, and health conditions/problems, which are stored in the database.
Meal Plan: Users complete a daily meal plan form, detailing their nutritional intake.
Fitness and Exercise: Users provide information about their exercise routines and fitness activities.
AI-Generated Insights: Upon submitting their health, meal, and fitness data, users can receive AI-generated insights about their health and fitness.
AI Recommendations: The integrated OpenAI API offers personalized meal and exercise reminders to help users maintain their health and fitness.
